# Audio-classification-with-Transformers
This assignment is given to train two architectures (CNN and Transformer) for the audio classification. In the Transformer, it is required to train the model with 1, 2, and 4 number of attention heads. Also, each of the architecture need to be trained with k-Fold validation method (k=4) and train-test split method for 100 epochs.
